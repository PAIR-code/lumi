## Running Lumi locally

### Set up Firebase functions and emulators

Follow instructions in
[`functions/README.md`](https://github.com/PAIR-code/lumi/tree/main/functions)
to install relevant dependencies and run local emulators.

### Start frontend web app

```bash
cd frontend  # If navigating from top level
npm install  # Only run once

# Create an index.html file and (optionally) replace the placeholder
# analytics ID (see TODOs in example file) with your Google Analytics ID
cp index.example.html index.html

# Create a firebase_config.ts file and replace the placeholder.
cp firebase_config.example.ts firebase_config.ts

npm run start
```

Then, view the app at http://localhost:4201.

### Storybook stories

To view [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs) stories for Lumi:

```
npm run storybook
```

Then, view the stories at http://localhost:6006.

### Local paper import and debugging

The import script in `scripts/import_papers_local.py` can be used to import a
set of papers for local debugging.

The locally imported papers can be rendered in `lumi_doc.stories.ts`
via Storybook.

## Deploying the Lumi app

To deploy the web app via App Engine, add an
[app.yaml](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/reference/app-yaml?tab=node.js)
configuration and
[set your Google Cloud project](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/config/set).

```bash
npm run deploy:prod
```

To deploy the Firebase cloud functions, see functions/README.md.
